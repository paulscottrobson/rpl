Compilation
===========

Compilation works backwards. Most tokens are just converted to P-Codes. 

The following are different.

) and ]
		wrap constants, strings, identifiers outputting them in either
		byte or word mode, until a matching [ or ( was found.

,
		ignored

"xxx"	
		code generated in the same way as strings (length + text), prefixed
		by the string-push P-Code.

:
		look what precedes it. 
		-	If it is an identifier, set the identifier to the current PC.						
		-	If it is a constant, copy PC to BackPC, and set PC to constant
		- 	If neither, then BackPC to copied to PC		

End		
		push end address on stack

Else
		pop the end address, code branch <there>
		push the address back on.

If
		pop the target address, code branch zero <there>
